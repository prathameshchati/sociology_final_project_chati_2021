            <h1>About This Project</h1>

            <p>This project uses an interactive website to help people learn how the body processes stress. The link you are viewing right now is attached to a GitHub repository 
                where I have written the code for this website. In general, this project reviews how our brain handles stress - the simulation tab will provide a brief overview 
                of several key parts of the brain, their function, and how they respond to stress.
            </p>

            <h1>Simulation Directions</h1>

            <p>Simply click on the simulation tab to the top right. Once there, a picture of a brain will appear. Click on different parts of the brain to understand how 
                stress impacts that region. In addition, it will also cover how that region of the brain responds to stress. Since the website runs through GitHub it, if some features 
                aren't appearing, try refreshing the page. In addition, it is adviced that you view this on a large screen such as a laptop - this code is not formatted for 
                smaller screens such as iPads, tablets, and smartphones. Hope you enjoy going through the project!
