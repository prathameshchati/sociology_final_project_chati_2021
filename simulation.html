            <p id='occipital_text' style='display: none'>
                <b>Function: </b>The Occipital Lobe is the part of the brain responsible for our vision, including depth perception, perceiving motion, identifying color, and 
                recognizing object features. Damage in this area often causes side effects such as hallucinations, blindness, inability to recognize objects, lack of depth 
                perception, and trouble perceiving our environment. <br>
                <br> <b>Under Stress: </b> Under stress, our body attempts to remain alert using reserved energy, even though our actually energy levels are depleted. Energy 
                levels in this case can refer to glucose metabolism - which produces energy for our brain as well. When there is a decrease in function of the Occipital 
                Lobe, we experience hallucinations, lack of visual perception, and dizziness. These are all signs indicating that the body needs to recharge with sleep. 
                These conditions are not unfamiliar to many college students, who spend sleepless nights studying for exams and completing projects. Thus, it is common for 
                students to experience some hullinatory effects throughout their college careers.

            <p id='corpus_text' style='display: none'>
                <b>Function: </b>Our brain is separated into two hemispheres (right and left lobes). The Corpus Callosum is the bundle of nerves that essentially bridges the left and right lobes
                of the brain, enabling rapid communication between the two lobes. Different sides of our brain have varying functions, therefore, it is vital that the two
                sides of the brain are able to communicate rapidly and efficiently.<br>
                <br> <b>Under Stress: </b>Although the effect is not as direct, stress and the excess of pressure on the brain can gradually degrade the Corpus 
                Callosum. Studies have shown that long-term exposure to stress can lead to volumetric changes in the Corpus Callosum, causing severe neural damage and 
                ultimately hindering cognitive abilities. 

            </p>     

            <p id='thalamus_text' style='display: none'>
                <b>Function: </b>The Thalamus is located near the core center of the brain, with the Hypothalamus sitting right below the Thalamus. Although named similarly, the Thalamus and 
                Hypothalamus serve distinct functions. The Thalamus is responsible for maintaining a state of consciousness and alertness. Broadly, the Thalamus has an
                overarching role in processing sensory and motor signals. The Hypothalamas on the under hand helps maintain bodily homeostatis - adequate balance such 
                that our body can adapt to its environment. Although the Thalamus is important for stress processing, the Hypothalamus directs the process more 
                closely. <br>
                <br> <b>Under Stress: </b>When the body is stress, the Hypothalamus triggers the release of epinephrine, or adrenaline. This hormone shoots through your bloodstream,
                giving you an immediate burst of energy. In addition, adrenaline impacts your heart and other organs as well. This light burst is healthy for you from time to time,
                however, under constant stress, the body overproduces adrenaline, which eventually causes a crash or "burnout." In the long-run, high amounts of adrenaline and cortisol, 
                another hormone that keeps the body alert, can severely damage the heart and other organs. For example, it is not uncommon to see early college graduates facing some 
                minor health challenges due to stress levels in college. Although trivial at the moment, these minor health conditions can progress into something more dangerous if 
                stress is not managed properly.

            <p id='pituitary_text' style='display: none'>
                <b>Function: </b>The Pituitary Gland is one of the most important regulatory components in our brain. The Pituitary Gland regulates things such as sexual development, bodily
                growth and function, control over other glands, and maintaining function of organs. It does this by synthesizing hormones. <br>
                <br> <b>Under Stress: </b>The Pituitary Gland also plays a critical role in managing stress, and functions adjacently to the Hypothalamus. When the Hypothalamus 
                produces the corticotropin-releaseing hormone (CRH), it causes the Pituitary Gland to release the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which further causes 
                the adrenal glands to release cortisol. As mentioned in the Hypothalamus section, cortisol keep the body awake and alert. However, an excess of cortisol can be 
                detrimental. In serious cases, where college students subject themselves to high levels of performance enhancing drugs (study drugs such as adderall or vyvanse),
                the body can immediately crash. This crash typically manifests itself in the form of an acute cardiac event or in extremely severe cases, death.

            <p id='midbrain_text' style='display: none'>
                <b>Function: </b>The Midbrain is towards the bottom of the brain and is part of the brainstem. It is vital is controlling the central nervous system, which involves
                regulating things like vision, motor function, vision, auditory senses, sleep, pain perception, and arousal. <br>
                <br> <b>Under Stress: </b>Although not a large player in stress embodiment, if normal function of the Midbrain is preturbed, you can become uncoordinated and 
                delerious. Perturbations in the Midbrain due to physiological challenges can be harmful in the long-run.

            <!-- <p id='pons_text' style='display: none'>
                <b>Function: </b>The Pons is also part of the brainstem, it lies right beneath the Midbrain. The Pons is also vital for maintaining your sensory functions (auditory,
                olfactory, vision, etc.). In addition, the Pons also maintains normal breathing rhythem and contractions of the lungs. <br>
                <br> <b>Under Stress: </b>

            <!-- <p id='cerebellum_text' style='display: none'>
                <b>Function: </b>The Cerebellum is sequestered beneath the larger brain lobes. It serves to help maintain balance and posture, coordinate voluntary movements,
                develop learning process for motor functions, and enable rapid motor control. <br>
                <br> <b>Under Stress: </b>

            </p>      -->

            <p id='parietal_text' style='display: none'>
                <b>Function: </b>The Parietal Lobe is located at the top of your brain and is responsible for somatosensory perception - this includes perceiving 
                pain, temperature, touch, etc. Our sense of touch, being able to understand the nature of objects by their texture and feel, is important in 
                helping us perceive our surroundings. <br>
                <br> <b>Under Stress: </b>Perturbations in the Parietal Lobe can severely harm our perception of our sourndings. We begin to lose track of objects,
                distance ourselves from reality, and essentially "zone out." Studies have even shown that under prolonged stress conditions, the Parietal Lobe may 
                undergo changes that alter and impair our memory. This facotrs into the Frontal Lobe as well. For many students, we cram and study all night in order
                to gain more knowledge on a subject prior to an exam. However, this is in fact counter productive. Without an adequate amount of sleep, we lose more 
                knowledge than we gain. 


            </p>     

            <p id='frontal_text' style='display: none'>
                <b>Function: </b>The Frontal Lobe, as the name suggests, is located towards the front side of your brain. It is responsible for maintaining higher 
                cognitive functions such as thought, memory, attention, planning, etc. The Frontal Lobe helps maintain our character as coherent and attentive - damage 
                to the Frontal Lobe can lead to severe learning and attention disorders. <br>
                <br> <b>Under Stress: </b>Similar to the Parietal Lobe, when the body faces stress, the Frontal Lobe function is preturbed over time. In the case of 
                long-term sleep deprivation, we become incoherent, inattentive, and unable to learn or speak to others. This disorganization of thought leads many 
                to commit irrational acts when sleep deprived or under large amounts of stress. 


            </p>     

            <p id='temporal_text' style='display: none'>
                <b>Function: </b>The Temporal Lobe sits slightly beneath the Frontal Lobe and is responsible for processing auditory senses and enconding them into 
                pieces of memory. The Temporal Lobe primarily deals with language processing, face recognition, depth perception, feature identification, etc. <br>
                <br> <b>Under Stress: </b>When we face stress, the Temporal Lobe is also impacted by the cortisol flowing through our bloodstream. Largely, we become unable 
                to properly process language, to remember facts and pieces of knowledge, and sense our environment. We become out of touch with objects around us, causing 
                clumsiness and often recklessness. This can not only lead to personal injuries, but it can also cause harm to those around you.
